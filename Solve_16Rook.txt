1) Learned on 64 bit occupy & mask => 64 x 64 x 1 [per output bit]
	It learned to calculate which bits in the output need to be set for all 4096 possible configurations per square

2) Learned on 16 bit pext => 16 x 32 x 1 [per output bit]
	It learned to calculate the correct translation between a gathered bitmask and the input for the scatter operation

3) Is it possible to create one network for one square? 
	Not with the current learning technique (too slow). But it should be a a lot faster and smaller. 

4) Is it possible to create one network for all 64 squares?
	No because you need to test every possible occupancy to verify a 100% score.
